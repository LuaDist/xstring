     * When creating an xstring object, throw exception if xstring module is
       not loaded.  Thanks to Ignacio Burguen~o for the debugging help and the
       suggestion for this error.
     * Load xstring module in perf test (!).  Benchmarks remain essentially
       unchanged, though there is now a tiny cost visible for collecting the
       xstring objects. 
     * Cure a couple of memory leaks in xsperf.
     * Separate the xstring module table from the metatable.  Just 'cause.
     * Tarball now creates a subdirectory.
